Excellent call-out.
This is not a cosmetic change — the dashboard + results pages are where your moat actually materializes. If these remain “AI Practice Lab–style,” the product will still feel transactional.

Below is a clear, interview-native redesign plan you can hand directly to your developer.

I’ll structure this in 4 layers:

What’s wrong with the current dashboard/results (diagnosis)

What the dashboard should optimize for in an interview product

New Dashboard design (sections + logic)

New Results page design (deep, sticky, job-linked)

No fluff, no UI fantasies — this is buildable.

1️⃣ What’s wrong with the current Dashboard & Results

From the AI Practice Lab world, your current UI is optimized for:

Sessions as standalone events

Generic skill scores

“One-and-done” practice

Content-centric feedback

That made sense for:

“Practice conversations / presentations”

But interviews are:

Goal-driven (get THIS job)

Comparative (am I improving?)

Memory-based (what keeps failing?)

Time-bound (next round soon)

So users currently ask themselves:

“Okay… I practiced. Now what?”

That’s deadly for retention.

2️⃣ What the Dashboard must optimize for (interview reality)

An interview dashboard must answer 5 questions instantly:

What jobs am I preparing for?

How ready am I for each job?

What am I weak at (consistently)?

What should I practice next?

Am I actually improving?

If it doesn’t answer these in <10 seconds, users drift.

3️⃣ Redesigned Dashboard (Interview-Native)
Rename it conceptually

❌ “Practice Dashboard”
✅ Interview Readiness Dashboard

Section A: Active Job Targets (TOP, always visible)

This is the anchor section.

UI

Cards or list:

Software Engineer – Backend
Company: Flipkart
Status: Interview Scheduled
Readiness: 68% ↑
Weakest Area: Edge Cases
Next Recommended Practice: Coding Debug (15 mins)
[Practice Now]

Logic

Pull from job_targets

Compute readiness from:

last N sessions

rubric scores

trend

Why this is sticky

Users don’t “open an app” —
they come back for their job.

Section B: Your Interview Readiness Snapshot

A simple, visual summary:

Overall readiness score (role-based)

3 strongest dimensions

3 weakest dimensions

Example:

Strong:
✔ Communication clarity
✔ Basic problem solving

Needs Work:
⚠ Edge case handling
⚠ Structured case answers


This should be derived, not manually curated.

Section C: AI Insights (Career Memory)

This is where you differentiate.

Examples:

“You’ve missed edge cases in 4 of your last 6 coding sessions.”

“Your case answers improve when you pause before responding.”

“You perform 18% better in friendly interviews than stress interviews.”

These insights come from:

Aggregated interview_analysis

user_skill_patterns

This section alone can justify subscription.

Section D: Recommended Next Actions (1–2 only)

Do NOT overwhelm.

Examples:

“Practice: Coding Debug — Arrays (12 mins)”

“Practice: Case — Metric Diagnosis (15 mins)”

Rules:

Max 2 actions

Always tied to a job or role

One-click start

Section E: History (collapsed by default)

Grouped by:

Job

Role

Exercise type

Not a raw session list.

4️⃣ Redesigned Results Page (THIS is where lock-in happens)
Rename conceptually

❌ “Session Results”
✅ Interview Performance Review

Results Page Structure (in order)
1️⃣ Context Header (VERY important)

At the top:

Job: Software Engineer – Backend (Flipkart)
Exercise: Coding Debug
Difficulty: Entry
Style: Stress


This reinforces:

“This wasn’t generic practice. This was for that job.”

2️⃣ Readiness Impact (new)

Instead of “overall score”, show:

Impact on Job Readiness:
Before: 64%
After: 68% ↑


Even a small change creates motivation to repeat.

3️⃣ Scorecard (Interview-specific, not generic)

Example (Coding Debug):

Dimension	Score	Evidence
Understanding	4	“Explained loop logic clearly”
Edge Cases	2	“Did not consider empty input”
Debugging Method	3	“Mentioned logs but no isolation strategy”
Communication	4	“Clear, structured explanation”

Evidence snippets are mandatory — this builds trust.

4️⃣ Failure Pattern Call-out (sticky insight)

This is gold:

Pattern Detected:
You’ve missed edge cases in 3 of your last 4 coding exercises.
This is now a recurring risk in technical interviews.


This uses career memory.

5️⃣ Rewritten Answer (only 1–2, high quality)

Instead of generic feedback:

Rewrite their answer

For this job / role

Example:

“Here’s how a stronger answer would sound for this role…”

This creates sunk value — users don’t want to lose these.

6️⃣ 7-Day Micro Practice Plan (job-linked)

Example:

Day 1 (10 mins): Coding edge cases – arrays
Day 3 (15 mins): Debugging method drill
Day 5 (10 mins): Stress-style coding explanation


All clickable → starts exercise.

7️⃣ Next Recommended Exercise (CTA)

Single CTA:
[Practice This Now]

No “back to dashboard” first.

5️⃣ What changes in the data model (summary for dev)
Dashboard needs:

job_targets

interview_sessions (linked)

aggregated readiness score

user_skill_patterns

Results page needs:

interview_analysis with:

dimension scores

evidence

rewritten answers

linkage to job_target_id

No new heavy infra.

6️⃣ How to explain this to your developer (use this verbatim)

“We are redesigning the dashboard and results pages to be job-centric and progress-centric, not session-centric.
Every practice must answer: how ready am I for THIS job, and what should I do next?
The UI must surface career memory, recurring weaknesses, and readiness movement.”

Final Recommendation (very clear)
