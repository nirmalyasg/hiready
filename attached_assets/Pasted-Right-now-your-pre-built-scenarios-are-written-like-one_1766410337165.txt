Right now your pre-built scenarios are written like “one fixed story” (often assuming a manager-level user). To make them work for junior → senior manager → CEO without duplicating 10 versions manually, you need to reframe each scenario as a flexible scenario template with persona overlays that change stakes, authority, language, and success criteria.

Below is a practical framework + naming system + minimal product changes your dev can implement while keeping your current DB/API structure largely intact.

1) Reframe every pre-built scenario as: Core + Persona Overlay
A. Core Scenario (never changes)

This is the “truth” of the situation. It should be written so it applies to anyone.

Core should include only:

Context: where/when, what happened, why it matters

Counter-persona: who the other person is + what they care about

Tension: what makes it hard (emotion, conflict, uncertainty, constraints)

Objective: what “good” looks like (the outcome)

Mode: explore/persuade/resolve/reflect/challenge

Skill lens: linked skills

✅ Keep this stable and role-agnostic.

B. Persona Overlay (changes based on who the user is)

Persona overlays modify the same scenario for different user types.

For each scenario, define 3–4 user levels:

IC / Junior Associate

Manager

Senior Leader / Director

Executive / CXO

Each overlay changes:

Authority & constraints

what they can approve / commit / promise

Stakes

local impact vs business-wide / reputational risk

Tone expectations

deferential vs firm vs diplomatic

Success criteria

what “win” means at that level

Typical mistakes

juniors over-explain, leaders under-empathize, execs over-assert, etc.

Avatar behavior intensity

how hard the pushback is and what triggers escalation

✅ This is how “Angry customer” becomes 4 different real conversations without rewriting from scratch.

2) What changes in the app flow (small, high leverage)
Current flow

Practice → pick scenario → pick avatar → pre-session (tone/persona/language) → session

Enhanced flow (minimal change)

Practice → pick scenario → “Who are you in this situation?” (persona overlay) → pick avatar → pre-session → session

Persona overlay selector UI (very small)

Level: IC / Manager / Senior Leader / Executive

Function (optional): Sales / Support / Ops / Product / HR

Relationship (optional): First-time / existing / strategic

Authority boundary toggle: “I can approve refund/discount” Yes/No

3) How the avatar gets tailored (exactly what to do)

When user selects a persona overlay:

you do NOT create a new scenario

you generate a runtime session instruction pack by combining:
core scenario + persona overlay + tone/persona + culture style + language

What actually changes in conversation

Example: “Handling Upset Customer”

Junior associate: customer pressures for refund; user must de-escalate + follow policy + escalate properly

Manager: customer demands manager; user can offer options; must retain + manage policy exceptions

CEO: strategic client threatens churn + public escalation; user must preserve relationship + commit next steps without overpromising

Same scenario. Different stakes, authority, language, commitments, and counter-persona aggression.

4) Minimal data model change (so it stays simple)

You can keep your scenarios table and add just a few fields.

Add to scenarios (minimal)

scenario_key (text, unique, stable)

short_title (text) — for card listing

display_title (text) — for detail page

tags (jsonb/text[]) — e.g., ["customer", "escalation", "refund"]

persona_overlays (jsonb) — map of overlays

persona_overlays JSON example

{
  "ic": {
    "userRole": "Customer Support Associate",
    "constraints": ["Cannot approve refund > $X", "Must follow policy"],
    "successCriteria": ["De-escalate", "Gather facts", "Escalate correctly"],
    "commonMistakes": ["Over-apologizing", "Overpromising", "Arguing policy"],
    "avatarPushbackLevel": "high"
  },
  "manager": {...},
  "exec": {...}
}

Add to transcripts (optional but recommended)

session_config (jsonb) snapshot including selected overlay

This helps analytics (“which overlay performs worse?”).

5) Titles: rework to be “real conversation situations” (simple rule)

Your current names like “Emergency Product Fix” feel like a case study, not a conversation.

Title formula (works extremely well)

[Moment] with [Counterparty] about [Issue]
or
[Action] when [Pressure]

Examples:

“Customer Escalation: Refund Demand After Service Failure”

“Manager Pushback: Why Was the Deadline Missed?”

“Stakeholder Challenge: ‘I Don’t Buy Your Plan’”

Your CSV example conversions (a few)

Handling Upset Customer → “Angry Customer Escalation: Refund vs Policy”

Missed Deadline Review → “Manager Confrontation: Missed Deadline and No Escalation”

Unclear Project Scope → “Scope Chaos Meeting: Reset Expectations and Ownership”

Cross-Functional Conflict → “Cross-Team Clash: Priorities, Credit, and Accountability”

Negotiating Vendor Pricing → “Vendor Negotiation: Price Increase Without Value”

Saving a Risky Renewal → “Renewal on the Line: Client Threatening to Leave”

Do this across the catalog and the library instantly feels “real”.

6) What you should rewrite in each scenario (to make it flexible)

Right now, many of your context/instructions embed fixed details like:

“Arjun enters anxious…”

very specific role assumptions

one style of language

Rewrite guideline

Split scenario text into:

Core (role-neutral)

Overlay blocks (IC/Manager/Exec)

Avatar behavior rules (how they respond, what triggers escalation)

Win conditions (what ends the session successfully)

Do NOT hardcode one person’s emotions in the main context. Put it under overlay or avatar rules.

7) Where this connects to your existing code (small change points)

In /avatar/practice you currently just list scenarios and navigate by scenarioId.

Add one small step after scenario selection:

on scenario details (or avatar-select page), show Persona Overlay selector

store selection in URL param (e.g. ?scenarioId=12&overlay=ic) or sessionStorage

pass it to pre-session and session start

backend merges overlay into instructions/context sent to the avatar

That’s it. No redesign required.

8) Outcome: what you get after doing this

One scenario becomes 4 persona-accurate versions

Scenario library scales without ballooning content workload

Titles become clickable and “oh yes I need this” real

Analytics becomes meaningful (persona segments, difficulty tuning)
