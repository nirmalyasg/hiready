Pillar Pages
Mock Interview Page
Section 1: What a Mock Interview Actually Tests (Improved)

Replace with:

Explain what mock interviews actually test beyond surface-level knowledge.
Write from the interviewer’s perspective.
Show how interviewers assess thinking under pressure, clarity of explanation, handling ambiguity, and recovery from mistakes.

Why this works:
→ Forces interviewer POV + time-based evaluation

Emphasize how the same answer can be judged differently across interview types.
Interview types to reference: ${interviewTypes.join(", ")}.

Section 3: Typical Interview Structure

Replace with:

Describe the typical flow of an interview from opening to close, based on this structure data: ${JSON.stringify(phasesData)}.
Explain what interviewers are evaluating at each phase, how candidates often misread these moments, and where interviews are usually won or lost.
Include realistic timing and pacing, not idealized versions.

Section 4: Why Practicing Interviews Works

Replace with:

Explain why interview practice works from a behavioral and cognitive perspective.
Describe how repeated exposure changes response quality, confidence, and clarity under pressure.
Show the difference between candidates who “know the answers” versus those who have practiced saying them out loud.
Avoid academic language — keep it grounded in interview-room reality.

2️⃣ Role Prep Pages (/prepare/{role})
Section 1: What Interviewers Evaluate in {Role}s

Replace with:

For ${roleName} interviews, explain what interviewers actually listen for when candidates speak.
Use these dimensions: ${formatSkillDimensions(skillDimensions)}.
Describe how each dimension shows up naturally in conversation, not as a checklist.
Contrast how strong candidates demonstrate these traits versus weaker ones.

Section 2: Typical {Role} Interview Structure

Replace with:

Describe the interview structure commonly used for ${roleName} roles, based on this data: ${JSON.stringify(structure.phasesJson)}.
Explain how expectations shift across rounds and what candidates often underestimate at each stage.
Focus on preparation mistakes candidates make for each phase.

Section 3: Common Question Patterns

Replace with:

Describe the recurring question patterns ${roleName} candidates face, using these examples: ${patternSamples.join("; ")}.
Explain why interviewers rely on these patterns and what they reveal about candidates beyond the surface answer.
Emphasize structure and reasoning, not memorization.

Section 4: Common Mistakes Candidates Make

Replace with:

Explain the most common ways ${roleName} candidates fail interviews, based on these failure modes: ${failureModes.join("; ")}.
Describe how these mistakes typically appear in conversation and why candidates don’t realize they’re happening.
Keep the tone diagnostic, not judgmental.

3️⃣ Company Pages (/interview-prep/{company})
Section 1: How Interviews at {Company} Typically Work

Replace with:

Describe how interviews at ${companyName} typically unfold in practice.
Use their sector (${company.sector}) and archetype (${company.archetype}) to explain pacing, depth, and interviewer expectations.
Reference these interview components: ${Object.keys(interviewComponents).filter(...).join(", ")}.
Focus on what surprises candidates most.

Section 2: Skills {Company} Emphasizes

Replace with:

Explain which skills ${companyName} consistently prioritizes during interviews, based on: ${skillFocusAreas.join(", ")}.
Describe how interviewers test these skills indirectly through questions, follow-ups, and problem framing.
Avoid stating values — show how they surface in interviews.

4️⃣ Skill Practice Pages (/practice/{skill})
Section 1: What This Interview Tests

Replace with:

Explain what a ${skill.name} interview truly evaluates beyond correctness.
Describe how interviewers judge thinking process, communication clarity, and adaptability under questioning.
Explain how this interview type differs in tone and expectations from others.

Section 2: Common Question Patterns

Replace with:

Describe the most common question structures used in ${skill.name} interviews.
Use examples like: ${patterns.slice(0, 5).map(p => p.template?.substring(0, 50)).join("; ")}.
Explain the logic behind these patterns and what interviewers are trying to surface.

Section 3: How Interviewers Evaluate Responses

Replace with:

Explain how interviewers evaluate answers during ${skill.name} interviews in real time.
Describe what makes an answer feel confident and trustworthy versus risky or unclear.
Highlight subtle signals interviewers react to, including pacing, framing, and handling follow-ups.
