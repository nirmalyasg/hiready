A3CEND Practice Lab – Admin & Insights Console
Purpose & Design Philosophy
Why this admin console exists

Protect margins (HeyGen + OpenAI + Tavily costs)

Understand real usage vs intended usage

Identify what actually drives retention

Improve content quality (scenarios, prompts, avatars)

Detect failure modes early (drop-offs, bad sessions)

Design principles

Decision-oriented, not vanity metrics

Drill-down first, charts second

Every graph answers a “what should we change?” question

Admin ≠ power user → simple, structured, explainable

SECTION 1: GLOBAL ADMIN DASHBOARD (Overview)
Page: /admin/overview

This is your daily check-in page.

A. Platform Health Snapshot (Top Row)

KPIs (last 24h / 7d / 30d toggle)

Metric	Why it matters
DAU / WAU / MAU	Habit formation
Avg sessions per active user	Stickiness
Avg session duration	Engagement quality
% sessions completed vs abandoned	UX friction
Error rate (session failures)	Reliability
B. Cost & Margin Snapshot (Critical)

Cost cards (real-time / daily)

Metric	Source
HeyGen minutes used	Streaming cost
OpenAI tokens (input/output)	LLM cost
Whisper minutes	STT cost
Tavily searches	Research cost
Cost per session	Core unit economics
Cost per retained user (7d)	Sustainability

⚠️ Highlight anomalies automatically
Example: “Yesterday’s cost per session ↑ 32% due to long sessions”

C. Usage Mix (High-level)

Pie / stacked bars:

Sessions by mode:

Built-in scenarios

Custom scenarios

Presentations

Think-it-through / Impromptu

Sessions by language

Sessions by persona type (manager, sales, general)

Why: shows where product value actually lives.

SECTION 2: USER ACTIVITY & BEHAVIOR
Page: /admin/users

This is where insights live.

A. User Table (Primary View)

Each row = one user.

Columns

User ID / Email

Role / Org (if applicable)

First session date

Last active

Total sessions

Avg sessions per week

Preferred mode

Avg session duration

Drop-off rate

Lifetime cost

Retention tag (High / Medium / Low)

Clickable → User Detail View

B. User Detail Page
1. Session Timeline

Chronological view:

Mode used

Scenario/topic

Duration

Completion status

Cost of session

Score (if applicable)

🔴 Flag sessions that:

ended early

had errors

exceeded cost threshold

2. Behavior Profile (Auto-generated)

Example:

“User prefers Think-it-through mode, uses app mostly between 9–10 AM, drops off after 2 minutes when sessions exceed 5 minutes.”

This can be AI-generated weekly for admins.

3. Conversation Style Summary

Aggregated across sessions:

Talk/listen ratio

Average pacing

Filler words trend

Assertiveness trend

Why: helps you see if analysis features are meaningful.

SECTION 3: SESSION & FLOW ANALYTICS
Page: /admin/sessions
A. Session Funnel

For each entry point:

Step	Drop-off %
Landing → Start	
Mode selection	
Pre-session setup	
Avatar loaded	
Session started	
Session completed	
Analysis viewed	

Segmentable by

mode

device

language

avatar

region

This tells you where UX is leaking users.

B. Session Quality Index (SQI)

A composite score (internal only):

Completion

Duration ≥ expected

Analysis viewed

Retry / continue clicked

Flag:

“Low-quality sessions” clusters

Scenarios causing repeated failures

SECTION 4: SCENARIO & CONTENT PERFORMANCE
Page: /admin/content

This is where you improve learning quality.

A. Scenario Performance Table

For each scenario:

Metric	Why
Starts	Demand
Completion %	Engagement
Avg duration	Depth
Avg score	Difficulty
Retry rate	Practice value
Drop-off time	UX clarity
Cost per completion	Efficiency

🔴 Auto-flag:

high drop-off

low completion

high cost + low reuse

B. Custom Scenario Insights

Track:

% sessions using custom scenarios

Avg custom scenario duration

Most common themes (AI-clustered)

Scenarios saved & reused

Why: validates personalization strategy.

C. Topic & Research Effectiveness (Impromptu Mode)

For impromptu speaking:

Topics with research injected vs not

Avg duration difference

Question depth (AI heuristic)

User satisfaction proxy (continue / retry)

This tells you if Tavily is worth the cost.

SECTION 5: AVATAR & PERSONA PERFORMANCE
Page: /admin/avatars
A. Avatar Usage Stats

For each avatar:

Sessions started

Completion %

Avg duration

Drop-off rate

User return rate after using avatar

Why: some avatars perform better psychologically.

B. Persona & Style Impact

Track:

Persona type → session success

Cultural style presets → completion & retry

Tone settings → session duration

This helps you prune or improve personas.

SECTION 6: COST & API MANAGEMENT
Page: /admin/costs

This page saves money.

A. Cost Breakdown (Filterable)

By:

user

mode

scenario

avatar

org

time period

Example view:

“Top 10 most expensive sessions this week”

B. Budget Guards & Alerts

Admin-configurable:

Max cost per session

Max daily cost per org

Max research calls per user/day

Auto-fallback rules (e.g., disable research if cost spikes)

Alerts:

Slack / email / in-app

C. Cost vs Value Scatter Plot

X-axis: cost per session
Y-axis: retention / completion

This tells you:

“What is expensive but worth it?”

SECTION 7: INSIGHTS & ROADMAP INPUT
Page: /admin/insights

This is strategic gold.

A. Auto-Generated Weekly Insights (AI)

Examples:

“Users who start with Think-it-through mode are 2.3× more likely to return.”

“Sales scenarios have higher retry rates but also higher cost.”

“Sessions longer than 6 mins show diminishing returns.”

B. Product Opportunity Signals

Tracked automatically:

Frequently typed but unsupported intents

Repeated custom scenario themes

Failed user objectives

High-interest topics with no built-in scenarios

These directly inform:

new scenarios

new features

prompt improvements

SECTION 8: ADMIN UX DESIGN (Very Important)
Navigation Structure

Left sidebar:

Overview

Final Guiding Principle (Share this with your team)

If the admin dashboard doesn’t help you decide what to fix next week, it’s the wrong dashboard.

If you want next, I can:

design wireframe-level admin screens

define exact DB fields & events to log

propose AI insight prompts for the Insights page

This admin console will quietly become one of your strongest competitive advantages.
