1. What stays the same (important to align the dev)

From the existing documentation, the following do NOT change :

Reused as-is

Voice-first avatar sessions (OpenAI Realtime + HeyGen)

Session lifecycle:
start → live → transcript → analysis → results

Interview Practice Lab core:

role_kits

interview_configs

interview_plans

interview_sessions

interview_analysis

Exercise Mode base routing:

/exercise-mode

case_templates

coding_exercises

Dashboard, Results, Admin, Cost tracking, Auth, Mobile nav

This is critical:
👉 We are extending the system, not replacing it.

2. Core Product Shift (conceptual, but crucial)
Before

Practice is session-centric

Scenarios / exercises are standalone

After

Practice becomes job-centric

Sessions accumulate into a career memory

This single shift creates your moat.

3. New Core Concept to Introduce
🔑 Job Target (First-class entity)

A Job Target represents:

“A real job the user is preparing for.”

This object becomes the anchor for:

Interview configs

Case exercises

Coding exercises

Progress tracking

Readiness scoring

4. New Tables to Add (Clean, additive)

These fit naturally alongside existing Interview + Exercise tables .

4.1 job_targets (NEW)
job_targets (
  id UUID PK,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  source TEXT,              -- linkedin | naukri | indeed | company | manual
  job_url TEXT,
  company_name TEXT,
  role_title TEXT,
  location TEXT,
  jd_text TEXT,
  jd_parsed JSONB,
  status TEXT,              -- saved | applied | interview | offer | rejected
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
)


Why devs need this clearly

This is NOT a job board

This is a personal job tracker

4.2 Link interviews & exercises to jobs
Extend existing tables:
ALTER TABLE interview_configs
ADD COLUMN job_target_id UUID;

ALTER TABLE exercise_sessions
ADD COLUMN job_target_id UUID;


Now:

Every interview / case / coding session can be tied to a job

Or remain generic if job_target_id is NULL

5. Job Ingestion (How jobs enter the system)
MVP-recommended approach (simple + powerful)
Option A — Chrome Extension (preferred)

User saves job from LinkedIn / Naukri / company site

Extension extracts:

title

company

JD text (best effort)

URL

POST → /api/jobs/save

Option B — Paste Job Link / JD

User pastes job URL or JD text into app

Backend fetches or stores raw text

Important for dev:
No scraping engine required for MVP.
Just store what the user provides.

6. Enhancing Interview Practice Lab (existing module)
Where this fits

/interview/* routes already exist

Enhancements
6.1 Job-aware Interview Config

Extend interview setup:

Before

Select role kit

Upload resume/JD

After

Select Job Target (optional)

JD auto-prefilled from job_target

Interview plan emphasizes:

JD risks

Company expectations

Repeated weaknesses from past sessions

6.2 Interview Plan Generation (enhanced logic)

Use existing /api/interview/plans/generate but add inputs:

inputs = {
  role_kit,
  interview_type,
  resume_profile,
  jd_parsed,
  job_target_history,
  user_weakness_patterns
}


The interviewer:

Probes what matters for THIS job

Pushes harder on historical weak areas

7. Exercise Mode Enhancement (this is big)

Your doc already has:

Case Study Mode

Coding Lab Mode

We now sharpen them.

7.1 Case Study Mode → Job-Aware Case Mode
Enhancements

Case can be:

Generic (role-based)

Job-derived (from JD)

New table fields (extend case_templates)
ADD COLUMN job_fit_tags JSONB;
ADD COLUMN role_level TEXT;

Runtime behavior

If job_target_id exists:

Prefer case templates tagged to that role/company type

Use JD language in probing

7.2 Coding Lab Mode → Explain / Debug / Modify (tightened)

Already present in doc, but clarify MVP behavior:

Coding modes (explicit)

explain

debug

modify

MVP constraint (important for dev)

No code execution

Evaluation is:

reasoning

correctness explanation

edge case handling

debugging method

Later → sandbox.

8. Career Memory & Learning Loop (moat layer)

This is what makes the app hard to leave.

8.1 New derived table: user_skill_patterns
user_skill_patterns (
  user_id UUID,
  dimension TEXT,        -- e.g. edge_cases, clarity, structuring
  occurrences INT,
  last_seen TIMESTAMP,
  trend TEXT             -- improving | stagnant | declining
)


Updated after every:

interview_analysis

exercise_analysis

8.2 Interview Readiness Score (derived, not stored)

Computed per:

role

job_target

Inputs:

Last N sessions

Rubric weights

Trend direction

Displayed:

On Job Target page

On Dashboard

9. UX Changes (minimal, clear)
New screens

Jobs

Saved jobs

Status tracking

“Practice for this job” CTA

Job Detail

JD summary

Practice history

Readiness score

Suggested next practice

Existing screens enhanced

Interview setup → auto-prefill from job

Results → “Impact on readiness for this job”

10. API Additions (concrete)
POST /api/jobs/save
GET  /api/jobs
GET  /api/jobs/:id
PATCH /api/jobs/:id/status

GET  /api/jobs/:id/practice-suggestions


No breaking changes to existing APIs.
