The Conversation Practice Framework

(A product-level model you can bake into the app)

This framework has three layers:

User Persona Layer – who the user is as a conversational actor

Conversation Situation Layer – what kind of moment they are in

Conversation Blueprint Layer – how the scenario is structured (your 6 fields)

Each layer is orthogonal and composable.

1️⃣ User Persona Layer

“Who is the user practicing as?”

This is NOT job titles or demographics.

A User Persona is defined by:

conversational power

emotional stake

experience level

typical failure mode

Persona Dimensions (baked-in, implicit)

Instead of dozens of personas, define 4 core axes:

A. Power Position

Lower power (student, junior, dependent)

Equal power (peer, partner)

Higher power (manager, authority)

B. Experience Level

First-time

Developing

Seasoned

C. Emotional Exposure

Low (intellectual discussion)

Medium (career impact)

High (identity, relationships, values)

D. Default Pattern

Avoids conflict

Over-explains

Becomes defensive

Dominates conversation

Withdraws under pressure

📌 Important:
You do NOT show this explicitly to users at first.
You infer it over time and use it to personalize scenarios and feedback.

2️⃣ Conversation Situation Layer

“What kind of moment is this?”

This is where most apps fail by jumping straight to “topics”.

Instead, anchor situations using Context + Tension.

A. Context Categories

(Where is the conversation happening?)

Keep this small and universal.

Core Context Types (v1):

Workplace (formal, semi-formal)

Professional relationship (mentor, client, peer)

Public / intellectual discussion

Personal / private conversation

Reflective / internal dialogue (coach-like)

Each context implies:

social norms

tone expectations

risk level

B. Tension Archetypes

(What makes this conversation non-trivial?)

This is the heart of scenario generation.

Define 12–15 universal tension archetypes that repeat everywhere.

Examples:

Misaligned expectations

Power imbalance

Emotional defensiveness

Uncertainty / ambiguity

Time pressure

Value disagreement

Fear of consequences

Conflicting incentives

Need for honesty vs harmony

Resistance to change

Credibility challenge

High stakes, low trust

Every good scenario has 1 primary tension and optionally 1 secondary.

📌 This lets AI generate infinite scenarios without becoming random.

3️⃣ Counter-Persona Layer

“Who is the other person in this conversation?”

This is NOT an avatar appearance.
This is behavioral psychology.

Counter-Persona =

Primary concern + response style + sensitivity trigger

Counter-Persona Dimensions

Each counter-persona is defined by 3 things:

A. What they care about most

Speed

Accuracy

Status

Fairness

Control

Safety

Recognition

Stability

B. How they respond under pressure

Pushes back

Withdraws

Becomes emotional

Becomes rigid

Seeks reassurance

Challenges logic

C. What triggers them

Being questioned

Losing control

Uncertainty

Feeling ignored

Perceived incompetence

You can define 10–12 reusable counter-persona archetypes that work everywhere:

Skeptical peer

Impatient stakeholder

Defensive manager

Idealistic thinker

Risk-averse authority

Emotionally invested partner

Overconfident expert

Passive resistor

4️⃣ User Objective Layer

“What is success for the user?”

This is where your app becomes practice-oriented, not chat-oriented.

Objective Types (choose one primary)

Objectives are not outcomes, they are user-controlled intentions.

Core objective types:

Clarify – make understanding explicit

Align – reach shared ground

Influence – shift perspective or decision

Set boundaries – protect time, scope, values

Resolve – close an issue or conflict

Explore – understand viewpoints without decision

Reflect – articulate thinking or emotions

The app should always ask:

“By the end of this conversation, what would you feel good about?”

5️⃣ Conversation Mode Layer

“How should the conversation unfold?”

This controls avatar behavior and pacing.

You already have this — here’s the clarified definition:

Mode	What it optimizes for
Explore	Curiosity, openness, understanding
Persuade	Framing, logic, emotional appeal
Resolve	Closure, agreement, next steps
Reflect	Insight, self-expression, meaning
Challenge	Testing ideas, surfacing assumptions

📌 Mode ≠ Objective
You might Explore to Influence, or Reflect to Clarify.

6️⃣ Skill Lens Layer

“What capability is being exercised?”

Skills should act as analysis and feedback lenses, not as entry points.

Examples:

Clarity of thought

Assertiveness

Active listening

Emotional regulation

Structured reasoning

Presence & confidence

Questioning

Each session can have:

1 primary skill lens

1 secondary (optional)

This keeps feedback focused.

7️⃣ The Full Conversation Blueprint (Canonical Object)

When baked into the app, every scenario — prebuilt or generated — resolves into this structure:

Conversation Blueprint
│
├── User Persona (implicit)
│   ├── power position
│   ├── experience level
│   └── typical pattern
│
├── Context
│   └── where + norms
│
├── Counter-Persona
│   ├── primary concern
│   ├── pressure response
│   └── trigger
│
├── Tension
│   ├── primary archetype
│   └── secondary (optional)
│
├── User Objective
│   └── intended outcome
│
├── Conversation Mode
│   └── explore / persuade / resolve / reflect / challenge
│
└── Skill Lens
    └── capability focus


This is what your app internally reasons about, even if the user never sees it explicitly.

8️⃣ Why this framework works (product sanity check)

Scales infinitely without content explosion

Supports any audience without forking UX

Keeps AI behavior consistent

Makes personalization systematic

Allows analytics to map patterns across users

Most importantly:

It trains how people show up in conversations, not what they should say.

9️⃣ How this gets “baked into the app” (conceptually)

Entry flows ask for intent, not categories

Scenario generation fills missing fields intelligently

Avatar behavior is driven by counter-persona + mode

Feedback references objective + skill lens

Over time, user persona is inferred and reflected back

10️⃣ One sentence to align your team

We are building a system that models conversations as structured human situations — not scripts, not topics, not chats.

If you want, next I can:

define the initial canonical lists (tensions, personas, objectives)

show how one real user journey maps cleanly through this framework

or help you translate this into UX copy and selection flows

show how one real user journey maps cleanly through this framework

Perfect. I’ll walk you through one concrete, realistic user journey and explicitly map every moment to the framework layers, so you can see how this becomes something you can bake into the app logic and UX, not just theory.

I’ll do this in three passes:

The user’s lived experience (what they see & feel)

The framework mapping underneath (what the system resolves)

Why this journey generalizes to any audience

A Real User Journey — End to End
User profile (implicit)

Let’s take a very common, high-value case.

User: Mid-level professional
Situation: Needs to push back on an unrealistic deadline from a senior stakeholder
Emotional state: Anxious but wants to be professional

1️⃣ Entry into the app (User’s experience)
What the user sees

The home screen asks:

“What kind of conversation are you preparing for?”

They see three choices:

Practice a common scenario

Practice my real situation

Practice a thoughtful conversation

The user clicks:

👉 Practice my real situation

What the user does

They type (free text):

“My stakeholder wants a delivery in two weeks. I know it’s not realistic, but I don’t want to come across as negative or incapable.”

🔍 Framework mapping (internal)

User Persona (initial guess)

Power position: lower

Experience level: developing

Emotional exposure: medium–high

Likely pattern: avoidance / over-explaining

(User never sees this — system infers it.)

2️⃣ Scenario clarification (User’s experience)

The app responds conversationally:

“Let me understand this better.”

It asks 3 short, human questions:

Who is the other person?

Senior stakeholder

Peer

Manager

User selects: Senior stakeholder

What makes this difficult?
(choices shown)

Time pressure

Power imbalance

Fear of consequences

Conflicting expectations

User selects: Time pressure + power imbalance

What would you like to achieve by the end of this conversation?

Get alignment on a realistic plan

Buy time

Push back clearly

Just express concerns

User selects: Get alignment on a realistic plan

🔍 Framework mapping

Context

Workplace → formal meeting / sync

Tension

Primary: Misaligned expectations

Secondary: Power imbalance

User Objective

Align on a realistic plan

3️⃣ Scenario preview (User’s experience)

The app now shows a clean, reassuring summary:

Scenario: Resetting an Unrealistic Deadline

Context
A project sync with a senior stakeholder who is pushing for an aggressive delivery timeline.

Who you’ll be speaking to
A results-focused stakeholder who values speed and decisiveness and may see pushback as resistance.

What makes this tricky
The timeline is unrealistic, but pushing back risks damaging trust or credibility.

Your objective
Reach alignment on a realistic plan without sounding defensive or negative.

Conversation style
👉 Resolve

Skill focus
👉 Assertiveness & clarity

Buttons:

Start practice

Edit scenario

User clicks: Start practice

🔍 Framework mapping

Conversation Mode

Resolve

Skill Lens

Assertiveness (primary)

Clarity (secondary)

At this point, the full blueprint is resolved.

4️⃣ Avatar & persona selection (User’s experience)

The user selects an avatar visually.

Then they see a simple explanation:

“How should the other person behave?”

Options:

Supportive but firm

Impatient and challenging

Neutral and analytical

The app subtly recommends:

“For this situation, you may want to practice with an impatient and challenging persona.”

User selects: Impatient and challenging

🔍 Framework mapping

Counter-Persona

Cares about: speed, outcomes

Under pressure: pushes back

Trigger: perceived hesitation or lack of confidence

This directly controls avatar behavior.

5️⃣ Live conversation (User’s experience)

The avatar opens:

“I really need this delivered in two weeks. Can you commit to that?”

The user responds.
The avatar:

interrupts slightly

challenges vague answers

pushes for commitment

The user:

hesitates

explains constraints

tries to stay calm

Time pressure is real.
No hints. No script.

This feels uncomfortably realistic.

🔍 Framework in action (live)

Mode: Resolve → avatar keeps steering toward decision

Tension: Misaligned expectations → avatar resists pushback

Skill lens: Assertiveness → analysis later focuses on clarity & firmness

6️⃣ Session ends → Analysis (User’s experience)

Instead of starting with scores, the app begins with meaning:

Did you achieve your objective?

Partially.
You clearly explained the constraints, but you avoided making a concrete counter-proposal, which left the decision unresolved.

How you came across

Calm and respectful

Slightly hesitant when challenged

Strong on detail, less strong on framing

Key moments

Highlighted transcript snippets show:

where momentum dipped

where the avatar gained control

where clarity helped

One thing to try next time

“State your recommended timeline confidently before explaining constraints.”

Button:
👉 Try again with a tougher persona

🔍 Framework mapping

Objective evaluation

Objective: alignment → not fully met

Skill feedback

Assertiveness gaps

Framing opportunity

User Persona update (implicit)

Confirms avoidance under pressure

Future scenarios can gently increase challenge

7️⃣ Why this journey generalizes to other audiences

Now let’s swap only a few elements:

Example swap: Thoughtful AI conversation

Context → Public / intellectual discussion

Counter-persona → Ideological but thoughtful peer

Tension → Value disagreement

Objective → Articulate a nuanced position

Mode → Explore / Challenge

Skill → Structured thinking

Everything else stays the same.

Same flow.
Same product.
Different audience.
