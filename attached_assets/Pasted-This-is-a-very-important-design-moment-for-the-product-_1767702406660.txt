This is a very important design moment for the product.
You’re right: “Practice by Skill” is directionally good, but the current categories are mixed abstractions (some are interview rounds, some are domains, some are personas).

Let’s fix this cleanly, logically, and in a way that your developer can implement without ambiguity.

1️⃣ What’s wrong with the current categories (clear diagnosis)

Your current cards mix 3 different things:

Card	What it actually is
Coding Interview	Activity type
SQL Assessment	Narrow technical sub-skill
Behavioral Interview	Interview round
Case Study	Interview format
Technical Deep Dive	Interview depth/style
Analytics Round	Role-specific round
ML/AI Interview	Domain
Hiring Manager	Interviewer persona

This causes confusion in workflow:

What inputs are needed?

What structure should the AI follow?

How do you evaluate consistently?

2️⃣ The correct mental model (this is the key)

Interview practice can be cleanly decomposed into 3 layers:

Layer A — What kind of activity is this?

→ Interview Mode

Layer B — What skill family is being tested?

→ Skill Cluster

Layer C — What context should be simulated?

→ Role / Company / Seniority

Your current UI collapses all three into one.

3️⃣ Replace “Practice by Skill” with Practice by Interview Mode

This is the right top-level abstraction.

4️⃣ Now the MOST IMPORTANT part: workflow per mode

Below is exactly what should happen when a user clicks each card.

🧠 1️⃣ Coding & Technical Tasks — Workflow
Step 1: Required Inputs

Role (or inferred from profile)

Seniority (entry / mid / senior)

Optional: Company

Optional: Skill focus (arrays, SQL joins, debugging, etc.)

Step 2: System builds plan

Resolve role_archetype

Pick task type:

solve

debug

modify

review

Select coding pattern (not question)

Difficulty calibrated by seniority + company archetype

Step 3: Session structure
- Problem understanding
- Approach explanation
- Solution / reasoning
- Edge cases & complexity
- Modification / follow-ups

Step 4: Evaluation

Dimensions:

Problem solving

Correctness

Explanation

Trade-offs

Calm under pressure

🧩 2️⃣ Case & Problem Solving — Workflow
Step 1: Required Inputs

Role (PM / BizOps / Analyst / Consultant)

Case type:

Product

Business

Analytics

Ops

Seniority

Optional: Company / Industry

Step 2: System builds case

Select case template

Apply company archetype lens

Decide complexity + ambiguity

Stage the case (progressive reveal)

Step 3: Session structure
- Problem restatement
- Structuring
- Hypothesis & drivers
- Data interpretation
- Recommendation

Step 4: Evaluation

Dimensions:

Structure

Assumptions

Clarity

Insight quality

Decision-making

🧠 3️⃣ Behavioral & Experience — Workflow
Step 1: Required Inputs

Role

Seniority

Skill focus (leadership, conflict, ownership)

Step 2: System builds questions

Use resume triggers

Select failure-mode probes

Escalate depth if answers are vague

Step 3: Session structure
- Situation context
- Actions & decisions
- Outcomes
- Reflection & learning

Step 4: Evaluation

Dimensions:

Specificity

Ownership

Judgment

Reflection

Authenticity

🧑‍💼 4️⃣ Hiring Manager / Role Fit — Workflow
Step 1: Required Inputs

Role

Company (optional but powerful)

Seniority

Career goals (optional)

Step 2: System builds interview

Align with role archetype

Apply company culture lens

Probe motivation & trade-offs

Step 3: Session structure
- Career narrative
- Role expectations
- Trade-offs & decisions
- Culture & fit

Step 4: Evaluation

Dimensions:

Role clarity

Motivation

Decision rationale

Alignment

Maturity

🏗 5️⃣ System / Deep Dive — Workflow
Step 1: Required Inputs

Role

Seniority

Domain focus (backend / data / infra / product)

Step 2: System builds scenario

Select deep-dive blueprint

Emphasize trade-offs

Stress-test assumptions

Step 3: Session structure
- Requirements clarification
- Design / approach
- Trade-offs
- Failure handling
- Scaling / extension

Step 4: Evaluation

Dimensions:

Depth

Trade-off reasoning

Clarity

Practicality

Adaptability

5️⃣ How this maps cleanly to your existing data model
UI Mode	Data used
Coding & Technical	role_task_blueprints + coding patterns
Case & Problem Solving	case_templates
Behavioral	resume triggers + behavioral patterns
Hiring Manager	role archetype + company archetype
System Deep Dive	role_interview_structure_defaults

No new tables needed — just better orchestration.

6️⃣ Recommendation for the UI (very concrete)

Replace your current grid with:

Practice by Interview Type

🧠 Coding & Technical

🧩 Case & Problem Solving

🗣 Behavioral & Experience

🧑‍💼 Hiring Manager / Role Fit

🏗 System / Deep Dive

When user clicks → guided setup modal asking only what’s needed for that mode.
