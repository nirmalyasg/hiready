HIREADY INDEX™
A Role-Specific Interview Readiness Signal
1️⃣ WHAT THE HIREADY INDEX IS (AND IS NOT)
What it IS

The Hiready Index is:

A role-specific, evidence-based signal of how interview-ready a candidate is — based on observed interview behavior, not self-assessment.

It answers:

“If this person walked into this interview tomorrow, how ready are they?”

What it is NOT

❌ Not an exam score
❌ Not a personality test
❌ Not a resume rating
❌ Not a generic soft-skills score

Those feel cheap and unshareable.

2️⃣ CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every part of the index must satisfy these 6 principles:

Role-specific – readiness for this role, not in general

Behavior-based – derived from what the user actually said

Explainable – user understands why the score exists

Progressive – can improve over time

Comparable (soft) – relative, not absolute

Respectful – never shaming or judgmental

If any dimension violates these, redesign it.

3️⃣ WHAT THE HIREADY INDEX MEASURES (THE CORE MODEL)

The Index is built from 5 foundational dimensions, common across roles, but weighted differently per role/company.

The 5 Core Dimensions
Dimension	What it actually measures
Clarity	How clearly the candidate explains ideas
Structure	How logically answers are organized
Confidence	Composure, fluency, self-belief
Problem Solving	Reasoning, assumptions, trade-offs
Role Fit	Alignment with role expectations

These map cleanly to interview reality.

4️⃣ HOW ROLE-SPECIFICITY WORKS (CRITICAL)

This is where Hiready becomes defensible.

Step 1: Role Archetype → Skill Weights

From role_archetypes.primary_skill_dimensions

Example: Data Analyst

Dimension	Weight
Structure	25%
Problem Solving	25%
Clarity	20%
Role Fit	20%
Confidence	10%

Example: Sales / Customer Success

Dimension	Weight
Confidence	25%
Clarity	25%
Role Fit	20%
Structure	15%
Problem Solving	15%

👉 Same dimensions, different importance.

Step 2: Company Role Blueprint (Optional Enhancement)

From company_role_blueprints

Example: Zoho – Data Analyst

Emphasize clarity + ownership

Slightly downweight polish

Upweight reasoning transparency

This allows:

“Hiready Index for Zoho Data Analyst interviews”

Which feels credible, not gimmicky.

5️⃣ HOW A SINGLE INTERVIEW BUILDS THE INDEX
Step 1: Interview Session Data Capture

From the interview session you already have:

Transcript

Turn-taking

Response length

Pauses / hesitation

Question type (from question_patterns)

Interview round type

Step 2: Dimension Scoring (AI Layer)

Each answer is scored per dimension, not globally.

Example (one answer):

Dimension	Score (0–100)	Reason
Clarity	82	Clear explanation, minimal filler
Structure	65	Some jumping between points
Confidence	78	Stable tone, minor hesitation
Problem Solving	70	Reasonable assumptions
Role Fit	74	Example relevant but generic

These are never shown raw to the user.

Step 3: Aggregate Across Interview

Normalize across question types

Apply role-specific weights

Smooth out outliers

This produces a session-level readiness score.

6️⃣ THE MOST IMPORTANT DESIGN CHOICE:
NEVER SHOW A RAW SCORE ALONE

Raw numbers feel:

exam-like

final

risky to share

7️⃣ THE HIREADY READINESS BAND SYSTEM (SHAREABLE)

Instead of:

78 / 100 ❌

Use Readiness Bands:

Band	Meaning	Shareability
Interview-Ready	Can confidently handle real interviews	🔥 High
Strong Foundation	Ready with minor refinement	✅ Safe
Developing Readiness	Needs practice before applying	⚠️ Private
Early Stage	Not interview-ready yet	❌ Never public
Public view shows:

Interview-Ready (Top 28% for Data Analyst roles)

Relative framing = pride + safety.

8️⃣ WHAT THE USER SEES (EXPERIENCE LAYER)
A. Private Detailed View (inside app)

Includes:

Readiness band

Dimension breakdown

Example feedback

Improvement suggestions

Comparison vs previous attempt

This is where honesty lives.

B. Public Shareable View (VERY IMPORTANT)

Shows only:

Hiready Index band

Role + company context

Top 2 strengths

1 growth area (soft language)

“Generated via AI interview simulation”

Example:

Hiready Index™: Interview-Ready
Role: Data Analyst
Strengths: Structured thinking, clarity
Growth area: Deeper metric framing

hiready.app

This is safe, professional, and proud.

9️⃣ HOW MULTIPLE INTERVIEWS IMPROVE THE INDEX

Each additional interview:

Enriches confidence

Improves reliability

Narrows variance

Show progress like this:
Attempt 1: Developing Readiness
Attempt 3: Strong Foundation
Attempt 5: Interview-Ready


People LOVE sharing progress stories.

🔁 10️⃣ WHY THIS BECOMES VIRAL (WITHOUT TRYING)

People don’t share because:

“Look at my score”

They share because:

“I’m interview-ready for this role.”

This is:

identity signalling

professional credibility

low risk
