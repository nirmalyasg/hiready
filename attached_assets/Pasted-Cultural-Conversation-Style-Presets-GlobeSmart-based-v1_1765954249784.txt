Cultural Conversation Style Presets
(GlobeSmart-based – v1 Specification)
Purpose

Cultural Conversation Style Presets modify how the avatar behaves in a conversation, without changing:

the scenario

the user objective

the skill lens

They act as a behavioral modifier layer on top of any scenario.

The goal is intercultural communication practice, not cultural labeling.

Design Principles (Non-Negotiable)

Behavior, not nationality

No stereotypes, no caricature accents

Style affects interaction patterns, not intelligence or competence

Same objective, different conversational path

Presets are optional and additive

How Presets Are Used

Selected during pre-session setup (optional)

Default preset: Global Professional (Adaptive)
